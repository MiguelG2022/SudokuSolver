# SudokuSolver

This repository contains two python files; one is the [sudoker solver](https://leetcode.com/problems/sudoku-solver/description/) and the second is the interface to run the solver. This script allows you to play a game of sudoku and you can customize the sudoku board in the interface file. 

To run the interface, you must install [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news), [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), and [homebrew](https://brew.sh). 

For devices with the M1 chip, here are commands to install pygame:

brew install mercurial

brew install sdl sdl\_image sdl\_mixer sdl\_ttf portmidi

brew install smpeg

pip install pygame
